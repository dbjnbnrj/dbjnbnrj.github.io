<p>I'm currently working as a Software Developer in Stubhub (San Francisco) in the Catalog Team.</p>

<p>I completed my Masters in Computer Science from UCSB with a focus on building software systems. I'm worked as a Research Assistant in the Petzold Lab, where I focused on building 3D models representing stochastic processes using WebGL, three.JS, backbone.js, node.js and Python. I enjoyed my coursework on Machine Learning and Data Mining where I frequently used libraries like networkX, scikit, ipython and to analyze data from sources like imdb and yelp. As part of my course built my own chess engine using py-chess and neural networks.</p>

<p>I love working for teams that prioritize ownership, creativity and intellectual curiosity.</p>
